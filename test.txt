I'm Buddhika Ariyarathna. Now I study in the department of computer engineering, faculty of engineering, at the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. I would like to expand my knowledge and learn new things. Thus, I believe it is best to get involved in projects. Robotics, AI, embedded systems, IOT, and hardware are some of my favorite career paths. Above all, I enjoy learning about new technologies
